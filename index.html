              >SONNORI Terms of Service<br /><br />Last Updated: October 31,
              2025 (KST)<br /><br />1. Acceptance of Terms<br /><br />These
              Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your relationship with SONNORI
              Corporation (“SONNORI”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), located at 16,
              Pangyoyeok-ro 192beon-gil, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do,
              Republic of Korea, and apply to your use of SONNORI’s games,
              applications, websites, and related online services across VR,
              console, PC, mobile, and web platforms (collectively, the
              “Services”).<br /><br />Use of the Services is also governed by
              the SONNORI Privacy Policy, which forms part of these Terms.<br /><br />By
              accessing or using any SONNORI Service, including browsing SONNORI
              websites or playing SONNORI games, you agree to be bound by these
              Terms and the Privacy Policy.<br />If you are between the ages of
              13 and 17, your legal guardian must review and consent to these
              Terms on your behalf.<br /><br />If you do not agree, please
              discontinue using the Services.<br /><br />2. License<br /><br />SONNORI
              grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable
              license to access and use the Services for your personal,
              non-commercial entertainment purposes, subject to these Terms and
              applicable laws.<br />You are responsible for any use of the
              Services by minors under your supervision, including any payment
              or in-game activity performed by them.<br /><br />3. License
              Limitations<br /><br />You agree not to:<br /><br />Misuse or
              interfere with SONNORI’s support or network services.<br /><br />Use
              cheats, automation software (bots), hacks, or modify any game
              files without prior written permission.<br /><br />Disrupt,
              overload, or attempt to attack SONNORI servers (e.g., DDoS, virus
              distribution).<br /><br />Upload, post, or transmit defamatory,
              obscene, harassing, or otherwise offensive material.<br /><br />Post
              nudity, sexual, or explicit content.<br /><br />Impersonate or
              harass other users.<br /><br />Infringe upon any intellectual
              property rights.<br /><br />Solicit, share, or misuse personal
              data of others.<br /><br />Violations may result in account
              suspension, termination, or legal action.<br /><br />4. User
              Accounts<br /><br />You are responsible for maintaining the
              confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities
              under your account.<br />Notify SONNORI immediately of any
              unauthorized use or security breach.<br /><br />Inactive accounts
              (no activity for 180 days) may be deleted without refund of any
              virtual goods or currency.<br />Deleting your account may result
              in permanent loss of saved progress or items.<br />If you wish to
              request deletion of your personal data, please follow the
              instructions in our Privacy Policy (Data Deletion Request
              section).<br /><br />5. Accessing and Using the Services<br /><br />You
              are responsible for all internet or data charges related to your
              use of the Services.<br />SONNORI may modify, suspend, or
              discontinue any part of the Services at any time for technical,
              legal, or business reasons, without prior notice or liability.<br /><br />6.
              Payments and Virtual Goods<br /><br />Purchases of in-game items,
              subscriptions, or virtual currency are final and non-refundable,
              except where required by applicable law or at SONNORI’s sole
              discretion.<br />You acknowledge that you do not own any virtual
              items, characters, currency, or accounts.<br />All in-game
              content, data, and virtual items remain the exclusive property of
              SONNORI.<br /><br />7. Intellectual Property<br /><br />All
              content and materials within the Services — including but not
              limited to designs, text, graphics, music, sound, video, software,
              and code — are protected by intellectual property laws and are
              owned or licensed by SONNORI.<br />You acquire no ownership or
              proprietary rights in your account, any virtual items, or game
              content.<br /><br />8. User-Generated Content<br /><br />By
              submitting or transmitting any content (such as chat, images,
              text, or media) through the Services, you grant SONNORI a
              perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce,
              modify, distribute, and display such content for the purpose of
              operating, improving, and promoting the Services.<br />You agree
              not to post content that is illegal, harmful, infringing, or
              violates the rights of others.<br />SONNORI reserves the right to
              remove or moderate content at its sole discretion.<br /><br />9.
              Limitation of Liability<br /><br />The Services are provided “AS
              IS” and “AS AVAILABLE.”<br />SONNORI makes no warranties of any
              kind, express or implied, regarding the operation or availability
              of the Services.<br /><br />To the fullest extent permitted by
              law, SONNORI shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
              special, or consequential damages — including loss of data,
              profits, goodwill, or business interruption.<br />SONNORI’s total
              aggregate liability for any claim shall not exceed the total
              amount you paid to SONNORI in the six (6) months preceding the
              claim.<br /><br />10. Privacy and Data Protection<br /><br />Your
              use of the Services is governed by the SONNORI Privacy Policy,
              which explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your
              personal data.<br />You have the right to access, correct, delete,
              restrict, or object to the processing of your data, withdraw
              consent at any time, and file complaints with a supervisory
              authority.<br />To exercise these rights, contact us at
              sonnori@sonnori.com<br />.<br /><br />11. Dispute Resolution and
              Governing Law<br /><br />Most issues can be resolved by contacting
              our support team at:<br />Email: sonnori@sonnori.com<br /><br />These
              Terms and any disputes arising from them shall be governed by the
              laws of the Republic of Korea, without regard to conflict-of-law
              principles.<br />All disputes shall be submitted exclusively to
              the courts of Seoul, Republic of Korea, and both parties consent
              to such jurisdiction.<br /><br />12. Changes to These Terms<br /><br />SONNORI
              may update or revise these Terms at any time.<br />Any significant
              change will be announced via in-game notice, website, or other
              reasonable means.<br />Your continued use of the Services after
              such posting constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.<br />If
              you do not agree, you must discontinue using the Services.<br /><br />13.
              Severability and Waiver<br /><br />If any provision of these Terms
              is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall
              remain in full force and effect.<br />SONNORI’s failure to enforce
              any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a
              waiver.<br /><br />14. Force Majeure<br /><br />SONNORI shall not
              be liable for any delay or failure in performance resulting from
              causes beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to
              natural disasters, war, terrorism, strikes, government action, or
              interruptions of transportation or communication networks.<br /><br />15.
